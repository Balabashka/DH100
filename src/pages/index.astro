          In the past, artificial intelligence existed only in films—smart machines, digital
          helpers, and computers that learned like people. Today, AI sits inside every corner
          of daily life, and one of the clearest places it changes is <strong>creativity</strong>.
          Machines now produce stories, music, and pictures that once demanded a human mind.

          This site explores how AI touches <strong>human expression</strong>, creativity, and
          the arts. The goal is to see what shifts when machines turn into
          <em>“makers”</em>, not to list technical details. Does AI raise the quality of art?
          Does it cheapen it? Does it add excitement? Does it drain meaning? Because AI does
          all of those at once, no single answer fits.

      <!-- HOW AI SUPPORTS CREATIVITY -->

        <h2>How AI Supports Creativity</h2>

        <p>
          Evidence shows that, instead of pushing people out, AI can
          <strong>strengthen their work</strong>. One large project studied more than
          <strong>4,000,000 images</strong> from <strong>50,000 artists</strong>
          using text-to-image tools like <span class="tech-term">Midjourney</span>,
          <span class="tech-term">DALL·E</span>, and
          <span class="tech-term">Stable Diffusion</span>. The numbers were striking:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Creative output rose by <strong>25%</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            The number of likes and favorites per view climbed by
            <strong>50%</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>More recognition was awarded—new artists gained exposure.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In short, AI helps people create a larger body of work, more frequently, and often
          at a higher standard.

      <!-- CAN PEOPLE SPOT THE SOURCE? -->
      <section>
        <h2>Can People Spot the Source?</h2>

        <p>
          Tests reveal that most viewers fail to tell whether a piece of art came from a
          person or from software. In multiple trials:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>75%</strong> of viewers thought AI art was human-made.</li>
          <li>
            When the origin was revealed, <strong>human</strong> work received higher value.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This points to a simple fact: we judge art not only by appearance but also by the
          <strong>identity and motive</strong> of the maker. Human creation carries emotion,
          effort, and personal story. AI can copy a style—yet it cannot state
          <em>why</em> the work matters.

              <h3>AI as a Tool</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Helps artists break through creative blocks, test ideas quickly, and explore
              directions they might never reach alone.

            </div>
            <p>
              Raises concerns about whether the result still feels human, whether it counts
              as original, and whether living artists will still find work.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Surveys show that most students and practicing creators plan to rely on AI soon—yet
          they voice the same fears: <strong>stolen ideas</strong>, <strong>fake facts</strong>,
          and work being passed off as original when it is not. New quarrels flare up daily
          about who owns an image, who deserves credit, and where the border between
          <strong>help</strong> and <strong>theft</strong> lies.

      <!-- WHY THIS MATTERS -->
      <section>
        <h2>Why Any of This Matters</h2>

        <p>
          Creating is not just a hobby—it is part of being human. Through art, people express
          identity, pass on stories, and let emotions surface. If AI starts to fill culture—
          songs, stories, pictures, headlines—what happens to the worth of
          <strong>human imagination</strong>?
        </p>

        <div class="big-question">
          Do we lose something, gain something, or both as AI becomes part of how culture is
          made?
        </div>
